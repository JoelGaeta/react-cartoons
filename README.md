This application is a memory game the user is trying to beat.

cartoon characters are displayed on the screen and allowed to be clicked.
However, each time a character is clicked it will be shuffled around the screen to a new location.
User's score will increase each time he clicks a new character.
The user must not click the same character more than once or the score will revert to zero
